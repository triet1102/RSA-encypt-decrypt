# RSA-encypt-decrypt

### This is my implementation of RSA encryption/decryption
**Notice**: At each time you run **./rsa** it will generate radomly new pair of public key and private key (in case you run the program 2 times: 1 for encrypt and 1 for decrypt it will not generate something different :D ).  
So if you want to keep your pair of key, just run the code one time then set your **public key** and **private key** in the code manually.
